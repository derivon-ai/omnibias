# Changelog

All notable changes to omnibias are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and each of the 42
distributions is versioned independently under semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-04 — initial public release

First public release. Everything below is new to the outside world; nothing was
published before this tag, so there is no upgrade path to describe and no
deprecation to observe.

> This file starts here on purpose. Development happened in a private tree, and
> a changelog of pre-release churn against changes nobody could have depended on
> is noise, not history. From this entry forward, every behavioural change is
> recorded.

### The primitive

omnibias computes the **closed-form n-th derivative of an activation**,
`sigma^(n)(z)`, for arbitrary `n`, with bit-stable accuracy and a **single
`sigma` evaluation regardless of order**. The polynomial coefficients come from
one shared pure-Python module, so PyTorch, JAX, and Keras 3 are **bit-identical
by construction** rather than by test.

The math is the Riccati identity (`sigmoid' = s(1-s)`, `tanh' = 1 - t^2`) and
the Eulerian / Legendre / Hermite recurrences it implies, extended to deep
compositions and mixed partials by Bell / Faà di Bruno combinatorics.

`OperatorBlock` dispatches six roles — `identity`, `grad`, `laplacian`,
`derivative`, `band`, and `integral`. The `integral` role is a genuine
closed-form antiderivative window, `S(z+b_hi) - S(z+b_lo)` with `S' = sigma`,
not a quadrature.

### Packages

42 distributions, versioned independently.

**Stable core** — `omnibias-core` 0.4.0 (pure-Python math: polynomial
coefficients, Bell / Faà di Bruno, multi-index jets, the rigorous
`omnibias.core.verified` substrate and the `omnibias.core.proof` certificate
format), `omnibias-torch` 0.4.0, `omnibias-jax` 0.4.0, `omnibias-ferminet`
0.2.0.

**Beta** — `omnibias-fields` 0.1.0 (the field substrate: `FieldState`, views,
`SigmaCache`, and the torch / jax differential-operator surface),
`omnibias-geometry` 0.2.0 (metric, Christoffel, covariant derivative,
Laplace–Beltrami, curvature, geodesics, exterior calculus, gauge theory),
`omnibias-pinn` 0.1.0, `omnibias-symbolic` 0.1.0 (neural-jet equation
discovery), `omnibias-fractional` 0.1.0.

**Alpha** — 33 further packages spanning quantum PINNs, curvature and
second-order optimisation, measure integration, score / SDE, variational
calculus, the `delta -> 0` difference register, q-calculus, time-scale calculus,
holonomic / D-finite methods, quantisation, Boolean algebra, spiking neurons,
modern Hopfield attention, certified verification, validated dynamics, SOS
positivity, the Mathlib-backed formal checker, differentiable discrete
optimisation (QUBO / submodular / structured DP / tabular / partition /
combinatorics / NP-hard families / routing / logic), convex programming,
spectral graph operators, control, shape fields, and the consumer agent-skill
library. `omnibias-keras` 0.0.1a1 and `omnibias-qpinn` 0.0.2a1 are the earliest.

Full inventory with maturity tiers: [`docs/packages.md`](docs/packages.md).

### Licensing

Two tiers, and they are not the same licence:

- **Tier P — `Apache-2.0`** (28 packages): the derivative tower and everything
  built directly on it. No copyleft, express patent grant, no commercial
  licence ever required.
- **Tier C — `AGPL-3.0-or-later OR LicenseRef-omnibias-Commercial`**
  (14 packages): the certified-decision layer.

The split is recorded in `[tool.omnibias.license_tiers]` in the root
`pyproject.toml` and enforced by
`packages/omnibias-core/tests/test_license_consistency.py`, which fails the
build if a permissive package ever gains a copyleft dependency. Metadata
follows PEP 639 (`License-Expression`), and the repository follows the REUSE
Specification. See [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md).

### Rigour and honesty

Claims are tiered and the tiers are enforced, not asserted:

- `omnibias.core.verified` produces **sound, outward-rounded enclosures** —
  intervals, affine zonotopes, Taylor models, QR-Lohner validated flow,
  Lehmann–Maehly–Goerisch eigenvalue lower bounds. Every enclosure is tested to
  contain both a dense deterministic grid and a random sample of true values.
- Certificates are canonical, hash-sealed JSON (format v1), tamper-evident via
  `verify_certificate_digest`.
- `theorem_prover_verified` is earned **only** by a genuine `lake build` pass
  against the Mathlib-free Lean kernel in `formal/omnibias-verified-kernel`.
  Asserting it without a pass blocks the verdict; with no Lean toolchain the
  bridge degrades gracefully. `mathlib_verified` is a separate, distinct tier.
- Methods are labelled honestly throughout: closed-form, forward-mode autodiff
  of an analytic quantity, and grid-based approximation are never conflated.
  `omnibias-fractional` is explicitly *not* closed form. Exact submodular
  minimisation is P-class and is not dressed up as more.
- The two senses of "collapse" are kept apart in every source, doc, and skill,
  and a terminology guard fails the build if they are conflated: the founding
  **bias collapse** is the `delta -> 0` limit in which `K` parallel hyperplanes
  coalesce into one carrying the derivative tower `sigma^(K-1)`, while
  **temperature collapse** is the `beta -> inf` limit in which a single
  hyperplane sharpens into a 0/1 feasibility indicator.

### Engineering

- Documentation is **executable**: CI runs every fenced Python block in the
  docs, and opting a block out requires a stated reason.
- Guard tests cover leakage (no absolute paths, scheduler tokens, vendor names,
  or secrets in any readable file), terminology, conceptual lineage, licence
  consistency, packaging hygiene, the public API surface, and agent-skill
  drift. Each guard self-tests its own blocklist so it cannot go vacuous.
- CI: 42 per-package test jobs, cross-backend parity, `ruff`, `mypy --strict`
  on the T1 workspace plus a growing curated-beta allowlist, `mkdocs build
  --strict`, wheel build with `twine check`, clean-venv import smoke, CodeQL,
  OpenSSF Scorecard, dependency review, and SBOM.
- Releases publish through PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC) with SLSA build
  provenance attestations; no long-lived credential exists.
